# Bitcoin Notebook on Dollar Cost Averaging over time

## Purpose
During a conversation with Obi from Coinfloor,
We discussed if there would be any realistic difference between buying Bitcoin once every day vs once every week;
And whether that would make any real difference over time in terms of profit over time.
