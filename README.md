# Bitcoin Notebook on Dollar Cost Averaging over time

## Purpose
During a conversation with Obi from Coinfloor,
We discussed if there would be any realistic difference between buying Bitcoin once every day vs once every week;
And whether that would make any real difference over time in terms of profit over time.

The format of this project will be in a Jupyter Notebook format with charts and diagrams;
Along with live code that you can adjust to have a different starting period


All in all, this is another fun project that I want to do, and these repos are just dumps of project ideas for me to practice my coding skills on.



##Technology used:
- Pinescript for Tradingview
- Parsing data from Tradingview
- Numpy / SciPy to graph portfolio changes
- Jupyter Notebook to present findings with live code for some interactibility
- Git
